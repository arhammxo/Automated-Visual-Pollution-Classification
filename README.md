# Automated-Visual-Pollution-Classification

Detection and evaluation of the following elements on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle
In this project, we built a machine-learning model to detect and classify different elements such as graffiti, potholes, and garbage in street imagery taken from a moving vehicle. To solve this problem, we used a combination of image processing techniques such as edge detection, object detection, and image segmentation and a machine learning algorithm such as a CNN. This model was trained and tested on a large-scale dataset of street imagery from a restricted geographic area in KSA. The goal of this project was to establish a new field of automated visual pollution classification and contribute towards the development of a "visual pollution score/index" for urban areas as a new "metric" or "indicator" in the discipline of urban environmental management.

There are several ways we can make the solution more scalable:
1) Using a distributed training approach: Instead of training the model on a single machine, we can use a distributed training approach to train the model on multiple machines or GPUs. This can significantly reduce the training time and allow us to train larger models.
2) Using a cloud-based solution: We can use a cloud-based solution (such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform) to train and deploy your model. This can provide us with access to powerful hardware resources and make it easier to scale the solution as needed.
3) Optimize the model architecture: We can optimize the model architecture to make it more efficient and easier to scale. For example, we can use lightweight layers (such as depthwise separable convolutions) or pruning techniques to reduce the number of parameters in the model.
